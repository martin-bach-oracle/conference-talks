# Conference talks

This repository contains code I used during my various conference talks. Please let me know if you have questions or comments

## Overview

The following repositories exist. As more talks are delivered, the list will eventually grow larger. Feel free to come back at your leisure.

Each conference I spoke at has its own, dedicated subdirectory. Please refer to the readme files for instructions how to use the repository and run the code.
