# Conference talks

This repository contains code I used during my various conference talks since 10/2024. Please let me know if you have questions or comments.

The easiest way to do so is by creating an issue, citing the branch.

## Overview

Instead of a "main" repository containing a subdirectory per presentation, you will now find a branch per conference talk. This makes a great many things easier, especially with regards to JavaScript and Python environments. 

Please use the relevant branch if you want to see the code. Main _won't_ contain code, it remains empty except for the readme (this file) and a license.

Whenever I deliver a presentation featuring demos, you should find another branch added to the repository. Feel free to come back and browse the repository at your convenience.

> [!CAUTION]
> This repository provides code, and although every effort has been undertaken to ensure it works and does not break anything, it's provided _as is_ without any guarantees or warranties. Refer to the LICENSE.txt file for more details.

Furthermore, I won't update the demos, they are supposed to reflect the talk, they aren't living and breathing projects.
