# Conference talks

This repository contains code I used during my various conference talks since 10/2024. Please let me know if you have questions or comments.

The easiest way to do so is by creating an issue, citing the branch.

## Overview

Instead of a "main" repository containing a subdirectory per presentation, you will now find a branch per conference talk. This makes a great many things easier, especially with regards to JavaScript and Python environments. 

Please use the relevant branch if you want to see the code. Main _won't_ contain code, it remains empty except for the readme (this file) and a license.

| Date | Event | Branch Name |
| --   | --    | --           |
| 10-OCT-2024 | POUG: Annual Meeting of the [Polish Oracle User Group](https://poug.org/en/edycja/poug2024/) | `241011_poug` |
| 21-MAR-2025 | APEX World: [Do you need to know about server-side JavaScript and APEX? Definitely, maybe](https://apps.nloug.nl/ords/r/nloug/event/session-details?p3_id=354&clear=3&cs=3uSlna8VgNLAF5hclrS14Aj-rkHAgxKHLIlKvJhBbGfou98gtiM9yLlCfMAVdSMEj9g-esDcFegedZK-WWDb58Q) | `250321_apex_world` |
| 18-NOV-2025 | DOAG Konferenz: [Ohne Git kein DevOps, ohne DevOps keine moderne Softwareentwicklung](https://meine.doag.org/events/anwenderkonferenz/2025/agenda/#agendaId.6588) | `251118_doag_git` |

Whenever I deliver a presentation featuring demos, you should find another branch added to the repository. Feel free to come back and browse the repository at your convenience.

> [!CAUTION]
> This repository provides code, and although every effort has been undertaken to ensure it works and does not break anything, it's provided _as is_ without any guarantees or warranties. Refer to the LICENSE.txt file for more details.

Furthermore, I won't update the demos, they are supposed to reflect the talk, they aren't living and breathing projects.
